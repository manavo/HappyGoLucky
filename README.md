# HappyGoLucky

This project is no longer supported. It was fun while it lasted, but there's no point trying to maintain an MVC framework when there are so many out there.

There might be the occasional commit here and there, but don't hold your breath.

Instead, I've made a model similar to how the HGL model works for [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/), my current framework of choice. You can find it [here](https://github.com/manavo/CodeIgniter-SmartModel).
